Week 1 Homework

It took me about 13 hours to complete.

I've completed the following stories:
Create an unscrollable detail view of Facebook post, such as the one above
Add a container view and modify properties: backgroundColor, cornerRadius, font, textColor, shadowOffset.
Add buttons with different images for default and highlighted.
Add UIImageViews and choose the right mode: aspect fill, aspect fit, etc.
Add a UITextField with a background image.
Add UILabels with attributed text (instead of plain text), so that you can bold individual words.
Setup CocoaPods for managing 3rd party libraries and use TTTAttributedLabel to style the link and make it clickable
Optional: The like button should toggle the "liked" state.
Optional: The left and right navigation buttons should be real buttons. In other words, when you tap on them, they should have a highlight state. The buttons don't do anything when you tap on them.
Optional: Tapping on the tabs (requests, messages, etc) should show other view controllers.


Also, implemented this but wasn't able to remove navbar and tabbar..

Optional: Tapping on the photo should show a view controller with a full-screen photo.
